# BigMath
A library meant to give the *programmer* the power to choose his or her level of precision for a wide range of mathematical functions

# "Wide Range"
What does that mean? 

* Trignometric functions 
* Constants
* Units control
* Surely many more

# "Level of precision"
A simple float or double isn't always enough. But the Java standard library doesn't provide support for BigDecimal in its
built in functions. This small library is meant to be that support.

# Under Construction
This library is still very young in its life, a newborn in actuality. The goal is to gradually accumulate more and more
functions that other developers or hobbyists might find useful, and help it grow. If we're lucky, we'll be able to give
it to the world as a mature, productive adult.
